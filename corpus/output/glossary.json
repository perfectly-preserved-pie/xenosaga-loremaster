When the distance between the two particles\n   reaches a great distance, say several light years, the spin\n   of one of the particles is measured.\n\n   At the precise moment the spin of one particle is deter-\n   mined, the spin of the other can be determined to be in\n   the opposite direction because the two spins must equal\n   zero.\n\n   Herein lies the paradox, since quantum mechanics dictates\n   that the intrinsic property of an entity cannot be deter-\n   mined until it is actually measured. By determining the\n   spin of the second particle several light years away\n   without measuring it, the experiment would introduce\n   the existence of some strange force that can transmit\n   the information of the first particle's spin to the\n   second particle faster than the speed of light -- a\n   force that cannot be explained by quantum mechanics.",
