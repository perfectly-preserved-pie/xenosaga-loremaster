-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Read as "Triple A class..."

   It is a designation given to areas requiring the
   highest levels of restricted access.

   As one of the highest classified components of Project
   Zohar, KOS-MOS falls under this designation.

   KOS-MOS' importance to this project is evident in Jr.'s
   comment that the only other entities with that class of
   restriction would be the "Federation government's
   motherframe, or the U.M.N. operating system."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The literal translation is "deep chasm."

   This word can be defined as a "deep hole" or it can also
   be a reference to Hell.

   The in-game reference is to a double black hole which
   appeared in Old Miltian space.

   Acute Neurosis Treatment Facility                                     004
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A medical facility on Old Miltia, where Shion's mother was
   treated.

   The type of illness or condition this facility specializes in,
   is unknown.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A.G.W.S.                                                              005
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short for "Anti-Gnosis Weapon System."

   A name used to describe all weapons systems designed to
   fight the Gnosis, not all of which come in humanoid forms.
   The A.G.W.S. were substantially downscaled in size to
   better respond to the Gnosis' sudden attacks, and are
   roughly equivalent in weight to a large automobile.

   Their primary power source, called the Transmit Generator,
   does not contain any fuel or energy-conversion device;
   all energy is transmitted directly to these generators
   from the mother ship or base station. Thus, the term
   "generator" is not appropriate for these systems. Similarly
   the propellants used by the A.G.W.S. for locomotion are also
   continuously provided by the mother ship or base, so
   A.G.W.S. can in effect run indefinitely as long as they
   remain within the area of influence.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A.G.W.S. (2)                                                          006
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A.G.W.S. come in various shapes which are determined by
   their functions. The Federation military's standard issue
   A.G.W.S. are all fitted with a standardized, interchangeable
   cockpit module. By exchanging their limbs, weapons, and
   armor, they can be modified to adapt to various situations
   and environments.

   Vector Industries' A.G.W.S. are not mass produced, but
   test models intended for eventual distribution to civilian
   consumers. Thus only government Special Ops units and
   certain divisions of the military have access to them.

   The A.G.W.S. used onboard the Durandal were also Vector
   made models obtained via the same channels.

   Albedo                                                                007

   Albedo Piasora

   In <Psychology and Alchemy> (1944), C.G. Jung refers to
   albedo, or "whitening", as one stage in the process of
   human individuation as symbolized in alchemic terms.

   A nickname for U.R.T.V. Unit #667, in reference to his
   milky-white hair.

   Albedo's Mech                                                         008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The details of this mech are currently unknown. However,
   judging from its enormous size (over 10m tall), its lack
   of equipment such as the D.S.S.S., and its ability to
   destroy Gnosis several kilometers long with one blow,
   it outclasses the A.G.W.S.

   Its primary power source also appears to differ from a
   standard generator or a transfer-capable generator.

   Allen Ridgeley                                                        009
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4743
   AGE: 24 years old.

   Assistant Chief Engineer of the KOS-MOS Project General
   Operation System Research Center, Vector Industries
   First R&D Division.

   Upon graduation from the University of Bormeo, he joined
   Vector's First R&D Division. Although he is two years older
   than Shion, Allen is her junior by one year in the
   corporate hierarchy of Vector.

   He apparently comes from a wealthy family, but he does
   not share details of his background with anyone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ...all part of the plan from the very beginning                       010
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Ziggy voices his suspicion that even if he had successfully
   rescued MOMO, arrangements were already in place to
   countermand his actions.

   The details of this counterplan include broadcasting images
   from the Woglinde the moment MOMO was handed over to
   the Miltian state government or any of its affiliated
   organizations, and the seizure of MOMO by her erstwhile
   captors.

   Indeed, the incident involving MOMO is closely linked to the
   events surrounding the Zohar Emulator.

   Judging from the fact that Margulis' "Plan 31" and
   "Plan 401" are interlinked, Ziggy's speculations
   seem fairly accurate for the most part.

   amplifier                                                             011
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A device used by warships to amplify the Hilbert Effect
   generated by the 100-Series Observational Units.

   It has a secondary function as an omni-directional
   broadcaster as well. However, due to broadcast limitations
   (coverage is limited to a 100km radius), it is necessary
   for several ships to use their systems cooperatively during
   battles.

   This device runs anywhere between ten to several hundred
   tons, so only large vessels or cities have them.

   All Federation Fleet warships built after T.C. 4766 have
   them pre-installed as part of their standard equipment.

   The Woglinde also had an amplifier onboard, but due to the
   lack of a complementary 100-Series Observational Unit, it
   suffered tremendous damage during battle.

   android                                                               012
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An artificial humanoid life form.

   The first recognized use of the term "Android" was in
   <"Tomorrow's Eve,"> a novel by Villiers de L'Isle Adam (1838-
   1889), to describe the artificial woman Hadaly.

   During the game, a character comments, "It's hard to
   believe they're making an android in this day and age."
   However, he fails to recognize the fact that Realians,
   whose biological structure is nearly identical to that
   of humans, can also be categorized as androids.

   In fact, this scene is a great illustration of Vector's
   technological prowess. In an age where "simulated" A.I.
   -- which rely on the spontaneous growth of networks --
   have become the norm, Vector continues to pursue the
   elusive goal of creating a completely man-made A.I.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   According to Jungian psychology, an image from the
   collective unconscious, an inherited memory represented
   in the mind by a universal symbol and observed in dreams
   and myths.

   The in-game reference is to the KOS-MOS prototype Kevin
   designed.

   Atalya                                                                014
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A planetary member of the Galaxy Federation.

   It is located in close proximity to the area in which
   the Woglinde disaster occurred, and functions as a
   relay point for the transfer column to Senir.

   Attract Inhibitor                                                     015
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A device used to inhibit the Zohar emulator's functions.

   In biochemistry an "inhibitor" indicates a substance used
   to block enzymatic functions.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Auto-Mode                                                             016
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An operational mode which relies on independent decision
   making.

   In this case, the term refers to KOS-MOS' ability to
   process data captured by her sensors, reach her own
   conclusions based on that information, and act on
   them.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   autonomous state                                                      017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Galaxy Federation is comprised of approximately half
   a million autonomous state governments.

   Each autonomous state, divided according to planetary
   systems, has its own administrative and law enforcement
   agencies, but the Federation government's laws take
   precedence over them all.

   Auto-Tech terminal                                                    018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An unmanned battle craft used by the U-TIC Organization.

   Each individual terminal is jump-capable, and carries
   approximately ten small remotely operated weapons
   units in a rear compartment.

   battle in hyperspace                                                  019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   If an object comes in contact with the inner boundary of
   hyperspace (the column wall), it disintegrates into
   subatomic particles.

   Matthews was referring to this danger when engaging in
   combat inside such a high-risk environment.

   Betty                                                                 020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A specimen of a transformed Gnosis in the Kukai
   Foundation's possession.

   She was named "Betty" for the letter "B" monogrammed
   onto her personal effects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A locking mechanism used to physically restrain KOS-MOS,
   located inside the maintenance unit.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   black box                                                             022
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A term used for objects whose contents are unknown.

   The in-game reference is to KOS-MOS' central components
   and their respective software.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   book                                                                  023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Refers to a book printed on paper, an antique in this time
   period.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   bookworm                                                              024
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An insult directed at people who spend all their time reading.
   Shion's brother, however, hardly seems to be just an
   average bookworm...



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Bormeo University                                                     025
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   One of the best educational institutions in the Galaxy
   Federation.

   It is a technological institution, and many Vector employees
   are graduates of this university, including Allen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Data which forms the essence of KOS-MOS' being is stored
   within these sectioned areas of her main database.

   Captain Lapis Roman                                                   027
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4738
   AGE: 29 years old

   A captain within the Galaxy Federation Military's Special
   Operations Command Intelligence Unit.

   She works for Helmer, the Representative of the Second
   Miltian government.

   Captain Moriyama                                                      028
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4727
   AGE: 40 years old

   Captain of the space cruiser Woglinde.

   Loyal to his mission, he is also quite generous and
   understanding towards his subordinates who all trust him.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   cargo weight                                                          029
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Tolls for the U.M.N. Transfer Gate are determined by the
   total weight of the matter to be moved, and the distance
   it will travel.

   Each class of cargo or passenger vessel has an assigned
   weight limit; the amount by which the Elsa was over its
   weight limit certainly cannot be attributed entirely to
   the addition of Shion and her party.

   The speculation is that the Elsa contained salvaged
   wreckage that was smuggled in at one point or another.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: unknown
   AGE: unknown

   A slender young boy, his perpetually melancholic expression
   as well as the depth and scope of his conversations give
   rise to the impression that he hails from a higher plane of
   existence.

   As he volunteers no information whatsoever about his past
   other than his name, everything about him, including whether
   he even has any memory of his past, is unknown.

   His relationship with Matthews and the crew appears to go
   back for quite some time, and they all respect him highly.

   His translucent blue eyes and silver hair are particularly
   notable features.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Cherenkov mentioned going to search for one at the dock
   colony, when Hammer asked where he was going.

   He was most likely searching for a vessel that would take
   him directly from the dock colony to his destination (in
   this case a facility associated with the U-TIC Organization).

   Commander Andrew Cherenkov                                            032
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4731
   AGE: 36 years old

   A Commander in the Federation Marine Corps, and second in
   command of the battle cruiser Woglinde.

   There is more to this man, than meets the eye.

   commercial model                                                      033
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A mass-produced product targeted for the general
   consumer, as opposed to those intended for the
   military or law enforcement agencies.

   This categorical distinction is often seen in firearms,
   where the military and law enforcement agency models
   do not differ greatly except for modifications that
   allow disabling of the full auto switch, or limiting
   the number of rounds in the cartridge.

   During the story, an operator comments "...even their
   commercial models differ greatly between those that've
   seeen action and those that haven't." What she means is
   that Vector must be trying to boost the appeal of the
   commercial model KOS-MOS to consumers, by building its
   reputation as a military model first.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   condenser                                                             034
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The in-game reference is to a device used by KOS-MOS to
   store the energy she requires to function. Due to the
   fact that KOS-OS' current setup was for simulated
   battle, her condenser is also a test version.

   Second Division on Second Miltia is apparently developing
   a working model of this item.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A condition in which communication lines are busy due
   to excess traffic.

   Connection Gear                                                       036
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A PDA often used by Shion and the others.

   When activated, a holographic monitor and keyboard appear.
   Its capabilities can be further expanded via downloads of
   various plug-ins.

   Best thought of as an advanced version of a PC, or a
   wireless phone.

   When telepaths converse with their minds, they must
   maintain a barrier so that subconscious thoughts are
   not unintentionally divulged to one another.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A specialized doctor responsible for maintaining the
   physical and mental health of Realians.

   The standards for qualification in this field are higher than
   other medical professions. Therefore, it is one of the more
   challenging occupations.

   However, the unabated high demand for counselors has
   resulted in a proliferation of temporary maintenance
   stations for Realians.

   Most counselors work in the companies which manufacture
   Realians.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The literal translation is "anti-terrorism."

   One hundred years ago, Ziggy was a member of the 1875th
   Special Ops Command Detachment of the Federation Police
   Bureau, a unit which specialized in counterterrorism.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   One of Shion's culinary specialties.

   A reaction by an American game fan who saw this scene at a
   recent game show was: "What the hell are they eating?!"

   Alas, culinary cultural differences...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A living organism which possesses artificial organs.

   An obsolete technology, once popular in the age before
   nano and Realian technologies emerged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A free orbiting colony, it also functions as Vector's
   headquarters. However, its 1000km size makes it
   more of an artificial planet rather than a colony.

   All the core branches of Vector and its subsidiary
   corporations are located here, including the First
   R&D Division and Shion's living quarters.

   Short for "Digitalis Beta."
   Read as "Digi-Beta."

   A plant of the genus Digitalis which is native to southern
   Europe. Although its leaves can be dried and used as a
   potent cardiotonic, it is also extremely poisonous. When
   ingested in quantities above a safe dosage, it can induce
   a coma.

   Whether Dig-<B> is an extract of the digitalis plant or an
   entirely different substance with the same name is
   unknown.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A process which entails disengaging the VR-2000, the
   conduit that connects the perspectives of two
   individuals, and transferring one's consciousness
   directly into the Encephalon of the other.

   This act of directly entering another individual's realm of
   consciousness can inadvertently cause one to lose their
   own sense of self.

   Also known as "diving."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4726
   AGE: 41 years old

   The director of Vector's First R&D Division, and Shion's
   immediate superior.

   Although he appears to be a simple easy-going person,
   as the head of an entire division, rumor has it that
   he is quite sharp and competent.

   DME addiction                                                         047
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An addiction which results from the consumption of Realian
   body tissue.

   The blood vessels carry the ingested tissue (mainly from
   the central nervous system) to the brain, which results in
   neural structural changes. The physical and mental states
   are then altered, but occasionally this results in death
   when an allergic reaction occurs.

   Once the brain has undergone an alteration, the addict
   must continue to consume new Realian tissue to avoid
   withdrawal symptoms, thus necessitating a drug dependent
   intervention.

   There is as of yet no complete cure since the consumed
   Realian tissue growns and mutates along with the host's
   neural networks.

   In some corners of the galaxy beyond the reaches of the
   Federation's control, there is an active black market for
   Realian tissue, as a new form of recreational narcotics.

   The external symptoms of ths addiction include hardening
   and cornification of the skin.

   A phrase spoken by Cherenkov's wife.

   She refers to the medication he requires to maintain the
   effects of a personality corrective procedure.

   Apparently individuals who have undergone this procedure
   require supervision, as evinced from her comment, "I'm the
   one who'll be held responsible..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short for "Double Slot Sensory System."
   Read as "D-triple-S."

   A device developed by Vector Industries, used to detect
   Gnosis in the imaginary realm.

   It consists of a double-slit camera lens mounted on the
   sensory area of an A.G.W.S. or other fighter craft.
   (The military A.G.W.S. have them mounted on the chest,
   while the Vector models have them on the waist.)

   The concept behind this device is similar to that of the
   double-slit light interference experiment often used in
   quantum physics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A network protocol used to connect KOS-MOS' perspective
   to that of the operator, via the VR-2000.

   Since KOS-MOS is a stand-alone unit and does not require
   external feeds, this protocol is used only when KOS-MOS
   is shut down.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short for "Electronic Countermeasure."

   A system or device which utilizes electromagnetic waves to
   interfere with electronic equipment.

   The in-game reference is to the ECM deployed against the
   Gnosis, leading to the speculation that it is more than
   just an electromagnetic countermeasure device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Length: 166m
   Weight: 8400t

   A Lohengrin class high velocity interstellar cruiser.

   Formerly a luxury vessel owned by a criminal organization,
   it was converted into a cargo ship by Captain Matthews,
   and used as part of the Kukai Foundation's fleet.

   Though not apparent from the outside, Matthews made
   quite a few modifications, such as the installation of
   hidden compartments to stow unlicensed weapons. He also
   upgraded the propulsion system to the latest Logic Drive
   (logic propulsion device), making it the fastest ship in the
   galaxy (according to Tony).

   The name "Elsa" comes from the heroine of Wagner's
   opera, <Lohengrin> (1850).

   Emergency Federal Charter                                             056
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Under normal circumstances, it is a violation of Federation
   law for anyone, including the Federation Fleet, to engage in
   military operations within an autonomous state's territory,
   without prior notification and consent of the state govern-
   ment.

   However, this charter allows for exemptions from such laws
   during certain predefined states of emergency.

   The announcement in the story, "The deployment is in
   accordance with the Federation Emergency Powers Act."
   refers to the invocation of this very charter.

   emergency level 3                                                     057
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Denotes level 3 of the emergency readiness system.

   Judging from the fact that all lines of communication were
   allocated to the CIC (Combat Intelligence Center), this
   emergency level is apparently invoked during Gnosis
   encounters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Secret codes used to control a Realian's emotions or the
   actions that result from them.

   These codes are easily executable via Connection Gear.
   However due to the power they exert over Realians, whose
   basic human rights are legally recognized, the use of
   these codes is limited to "emergency-only" situations.
   Only members of Vector's Third R&D Division and a limited
   number of other employees know of their existence.

   EPR (EPR Paradox)                                                     062
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A paradoxical theory presented in 1935 by Albert Einstein,
   Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in support of their
   argument that quantum mechanics still falls short in
   its explanation of reality.

   A simple theoretical experiment to illustrate this paradox
   consists of a particle decaying into two identical particles.
   Because the internal angular momentum or spin of the
   particle must be conserved, the two decaying particles
   will have two opposing spins.

   As these particles decay, they are launched in opposite
   directions. When the distance between the two particles
   reaches a great distance, say several light years, the spin
   of one of the particles is measured.

   At the precise moment the spin of one particle is deter-
   mined, the spin of the other can be determined to be in
   the opposite direction because the two spins must equal
   zero.

   Herein lies the paradox, since quantum mechanics dictates
   that the intrinsic property of an entity cannot be deter-
   mined until it is actually measured. By determining the
   spin of the second particle several light years away
   without measuring it, the experiment would introduce
   the existence of some strange force that can transmit
   the information of the first particle's spin to the
   second particle faster than the speed of light -- a
   force that cannot be explained by quantum mechanics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short for "Especial Theory of Rudimentary."

   A generic term to denote various types of special powers.
   It encompasses everything from paranormal abilities, to
   medical treatments using nanomachines, as well as the
   ability to control spatial dimensions using transference
   technology.

   The Ether skills used by Shion, KOS-MOS, Ziggy, and MOMO
   can be categorized into two types: those using applied
   transference technology, or special skills which use
   nanomachines.

   In real life, "ether" is a hypothetical medium with special
   light-conductive characteristics which is believed to fill
   air and space.

   The central governing body of the Galaxy Federation is
   comprised of Representatives from all member systems.

   A conference of the highest level to determine the course

   Executive Committee Director                                          067
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A title given to the head of the Executive Committee.

   Since Federation law grants the person in this position
   enormous influence over all federal policymaking, he or
   she must be elected to the seat by a majority vote
   from the entire Federation government.

   Wilhelm, CEO of Vector Industries, served in this post
   until several years ago.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Refers to certain features that are part of the original
   spec for products shipped direct from the factory.

   When Realians are shipped out of the factory, they have
   pre-installed security measures so that subsequent
   maintenance can only be done at properly equipped
   facilities or by qualified individuals. This is to
   prevent the use of Realians in criminal acts.

   FAE (Fuel-Air-Explosive)                                              069
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Conventional FAEs disperse a cloud of fuel which is then
   ignited once it reaches the intended coverage, resulting
   in a powerful explosion. Those in close proximity to this
   explosion will either be flattened by the massive pressure
   wave, incinerated by the extremely high heat, or suffer
   the effects of rapid decompression caused by the updraft
   of super heated air (mainly suffocation and internal
   hemorrhage).

   The largest weapon of this type has a range with a radius
   of several kilometers.

   Although the FAE used by the Gnosis is smaller, it appears
   to have the same effects. However, the substance used as
   fuel is unknown.

   Here, by the way, is another mystery:
   Since Virgil was inside an A.G.W.S., his survival can be
   explained but how could Shion, who was totally unprotected,
   come out unscathed? It appears that Shion is quite a bit
   tougher than she looks.

   BORN: T.C. 4741
   AGE: 26 years old

   The chairman of the Kukai Foundation, a special Foundation
   based in Miltia (an autonomous member state of the Galaxy
   Federation).

   With black hair and deep green eyes, he shares some
   semblance to Jr. He has a gentle personality and is well

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   U.R.T.V. Unit #669.

   A biological weapon whose life energy wavelength cancels
   that of U-DO. All 669 U.R.T.V. units originated from the
   same embryonic culture, but were then subjected to an
   induced mutation to develop their unique gifts. This
   accounts for the differences in hair or eye color
   despite their shared embryonic origins.

   Jr.'s ability is to control growth (time), while Albedo can
   regenerate his own body. Gaignun can telepathically
   communicate with Jr., but uses his voice to hypnotically
   manipulate people.

   "Kukai" was a fictional persona created by the second
   Miltian government, as a means to pool their special
   operations funds. Following the Miltian Conflict, and
   Helmer's rescue of Gaignan and Jr., they took on the
   Kukai surname to justify and establish the Kukai
   Foundation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Entities shrouded in mystery, of which the only known
   attribute is their hostility toward mankind.

   Gnosis exist in a unique dimension, separate from the
   physical plane. Therefore it is normally impossible to
   come into contact with them.

   Due to the variations in external appearance, the
   standard practice is to name them after mythical
   creatures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An image from Allen's recollection which he speaks of
   during a conversation at the Durandal's observatory.

   The vision is of Shion as she mourns at Kevin's grave two
   years ago. The grave itself is located at the central
   cemetery inside the Dämmerung. The engraving on the
   headstone reads:

     Kevin Winnicot
     4739 - 4765
     ecce universa terra coram te est recede a me obsecro

   The Latin text is a quote from the Bible. They are Abram's
   words to Lot:

     <[Is] not the whole land before thee? separate thyself,
     I pray thee, from me: if [thou wilt take] the left hand,
     then I will go to the right; or if [thou depart] to the
     right hand, then I will go to the left.
     (Genesis 13:9)>

   The emblem of the Galaxy Federation also reflects these
   same words.

   Navigator on the passenger cargo ship Elsa.

   He may not look it, but he was once revered as a brilliant
   hacker in his teens. However, he got in way over his head
   when he hacked into a criminal organization's database,
   and he has been on the run since then.

   He was rescued by Matthews, and the two have worked
   together ever since. He knows Tony, the pilot, since
   childhood.

   Although he may be a clown, he is an excellent navigator
   and engineer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The object thrown at Cherenkov by his wife.

   A sensory linkage device using the U.M.N. as a conduit, it
   provides virtual reality experiences at home. It is similar to
   the goggles used by Shion and her team for KOS-MOS'
   maintenance.

   The phrase, "I can get all the love I need with this!" refers
   to her "affair" with another man via the headgear. That,
   combined with the fact that she applied for self-cloning,
   indicates that she does not seek direct contact with
   another individual, in any way.

   Regardless, our hearts go out to poor Cherenkov who was
   simply used and abused.

   BORN: T.C. 4711
   AGE: 56 years old

   The Representative of the current autonomous Miltian state
   government.

   A former military officer, he is a sympathetic ally of Jr. and
   Gaignun, and he was partially responsible for the
   establishment of the Kukai Foundation.

   He fears the U-TIC Organization's rise in power and the
   awakening of U-DO.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A device which generates a finitely bound realm (a
   "sensory" realm, to be exact), to enable an inter-
   section with the imaginary realm.

   There are specific wave energies that exist in both the
   realms of real numbers and imaginary numbers. This device
   "interprets" such wave energies into a "common language,"
   thereby allowing the physical realm to interact with the
   imaginary realm (the realm of Planck scales).

   What this means, then, is that the Gnosis, which exist
   outside our physical laws, can effectively be dealt
   with using a physical, real-world approach.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The group of hoodlums who confront Cherenkov at the dock
   colony.

   It is uncertain whether they resented soldiers in particular,
   or if they were simply looking for a fight. Either way, all of
   them get the daylights beaten out of them by an out of
   control Cherenkov.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A realm of alternate space that vessels pass through during
   a gate-jump.

   It is shaped like a tube, and is thought to be similar in nature
   to what are commonly known as wormholes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   One of the psychological outcomes of adolescence, as
   proposed by developmental psychologist Erik Erikson.

   A state in which an individual has an incomplete sense
   of self, a result of the inability to resolve identity
   conflicts during adolescence.

   illusion and reality                                                  094
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Since humans process all incoming information within the
   mind, there is no clear distinction between reality and
   hallucination. Surely you've experienced this: a moment
   of pure bliss in which everything around you suddenly
   looked brighter, due to one reason or another.

   That is, from the perspective of the observer, everything
   that is perceived as "real" is in fact only real within the
   observer's mind. Furthermore, there is absolutely no proof
   to deny the possibility that the world as we know it,
   exists entirely as a figment of our imagination.

   That is the point Shion was trying to make.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Mutual interaction.

   The in-game reference is to the act of establishing a non-
   local connection using the VR-2000. This method frees
   data transference from the limitations of physics,
   allowing an instantaneous exchange of data across
   distances millions of light years apart.

   It utilizes the EPR Paradox, which constitutes the
   heart of the U.M.N.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An exchange of thought between two individuals who are
   physically connected via an apparatus.

   This is normally achieved by tapping into the U.M.N. network
   via a control device implanted inside the body.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A holding area within the Durandal, used to quarantine the
   Zohar.

   Since the Zohar emulators emit a certain wavelength of
   energy that attract the Gnosis, all recovered emulators
   are kept in a specialized protective container.

   AGE: 35 years old

   His full name is Jin Uzuki and he is Shion's older brother,
   related by blood.

   It is difficult to discern his characteristics from just the
   visuals, but he does appear to be hiding something behind
   that goofy look.

   He is an expert swordsman -- maybe.

   Unfortunately his moment to shine will not arrive until
   the next episode (our apologies to those of you who
   are just dying to see him in action).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4701
   AGE: 52 years old at time of death

   An advocate of the 100-Series Observational Units, and
   essentially MOMO's father.

   A scientist renowned for his genius, he died in T.C. 4753,
   the year the Miltian Conflict began. The Federation
   benefited greatly from his contributions, as his
   numerous research findings played a large part in
   the Federation's growth.

   He was also Juli Mizrahi's former husband.

   Gaignun Kukai Jr., director of Kukai Foundation.

   His hobby is collecting ancient text and literature, as well as
   ancient (relative to his time period) weapons.

   The official records state that he was born in T.C. 4755 and
   is the adopted son of Gaignun Kukai.

   BORN: T.C. 4740
   AGE: 26 years old

   One of the surviving U.R.T.V. units, he is a human specially
   "created" as an antithesis to U-DO, the living consciousness
   which jeopardized the Galaxy Federation in the past.

   His relationship to Albedo and Gaignun Sr. shall be revealed
   in further detail, in subsequent episodes.

   BORN: T.C. 4723
   AGE: 44 years old

   One of the top members of the Galaxy Federation's
   Subcommittee on Close Encounters (S.O.C.E.) and widow
   of the late Joachim Mizrahi.

   In T.C. 4754, her alarm over the increase in Gnosis
   phenomena prompted her to form the S.O.C.E. She is the
   current legal guardian of MOMO, one of the 100-Series
   Observational Units which she developed in conjunction
   with her late husband Joachim.

   Her maiden name is Niwashiro.

   BORN: T.C. 4739
   AGE: 26 years old

   Former Chief Engineer of the KOS-MOS project, Vector
   Industries First R&D Division.

   He was Shion's immediate superior and also her boyfriend,
   but he was killed 2 years ago during an incident when
   KOS-MOS went out of control.

   He was in charge of not only KOS-MOS' software compo-
   nents, but the design and development of its hardware
   as well. The hardware for the current KOS-MOS was
   developed by Second Division, at a later time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   When bursts of electrical charges occur repeatedly in the
   brain, and neural impulses pass through the limbic system
   repetitively, the result is a permanent acceleration of 
   certain neural connections or the opening of entirely new
   neural paths.

   Kindling is any process that permanently alters the inner
   emotional state-of-being of the host.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An armored female android developed by the interstellar
   conglomerate, Vector Industries.

   She is comprised entirely of mechanical parts, a rarity in
   an age of advanced Realian technology. The basic tenet to
   which she adheres to is based on logic, probability, and
   completion of her mission above all else. She also
   unconditionally protects Shion, her creator.

   She is equipped with a "simulated personality OS" to aid in
   communication, and though her speech conveys her role as
   an android in service to humans, her tendency to put logic
   and probability first makes her quite difficult to manage
   at times.

   The name KOS-MOS is a general acronym to denote an anti-
   Gnosis tactical system. It stands for "Kosmos Obey
   Strategic Multiple Operation Systems."

   The equipment KOS-MOS would have when ready for
   deployment.

   Since the military brass was getting impatient with the slow
   pace of development, Allen thought to stave off their
   worries by handing Shion a list of equipment which
   Second Division provided.

   Kukai Foundation (2)                                                  112
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Kukai Foundation was a special organization establish-
   ed soon after the end of the Miltian Conflict, and its
   sole purpose was to subjugate the U-TIC Organization.

   Since then, most of its military forces were decommission-
   ed, and the other divisions branched off into independent
   civilian corporations, thus forming the basis of the
   foundation's present structure.

   The fact that Vector is one of its primary investors
   explains why the lion's share of the equipment
   installed onboard the Durandal, is made by Vector.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Legend has it that Daedalus built a great maze in Knossos,
   Crete, to imprison the half-human, half-beast minotaur.

   It is unknown as to why this name was given to an U-TIC
   Organization facility.

   The etymology is <Labrys>, a Greek word for a double-bladed
   ax.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4734
   Age: 33 years old

   A member of the U-TIC Organization and a subordinate of
   Cherenkov's.

   He infiltrated the Woglinde in order to take possession of
   the Zohar.

   He tends to wear his heart on his sleeve, but he is very
   conscientious of his duties, and quite the stickler for
   regulations, and time.

   He has an older brother whom he was separated from at
   birth.

   Lieutenant Commander Vanderkam                                        116
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A lieutenant commander in the U-TIC Organization.

   Rumor has it that he was onboard the Woglinde to secure the
   Zohar.

   Whether he was the same officer who reprimanded Shion is as
   of yet unknown.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A life preservation craft used in emergencies.

   The Woglinde was equipped with many of these life pods,
   but by the time Shion and Allen escaped, only one remained.

   Maximum occupancy is limited to two, and the life support
   system can run for 500 hours. However, judging from the
   levels of remaining oxygen, it seems that Shion's pod
   already had problems on or before takeoff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Introduced as a bill in T.C. 4590, it passed with unusual
   speed and was voted into law the following year, in 4591.

   In the age when cyborg technology was at its peak, human
   resources were dwindling and this law was intended for
   "effective utilization" of these resources.

   However, with time the interpretation of the law expanded
   to condone human cloning, genetic and neural engineering,
   and other procedures formerly considered to be off-limits.

   Various corporate interests are suspected to be behind
   this development.

   This law remained in effect for 160 years, until it was
   revoked in T.C. 4754.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A term which encompasses individuals or their descendants
   who have had their DNA, neural structure, or other bio-
   logical components heavily modified. Some may display
   extraordinary physical abilities or superhuman powers
   depending on the level of modification, but on the
   other hand many suffer from adverse mental effects.

   In the case of Cherenkov, he was part of a Super Soldier
   program developed by a "certain branch of the military."
   He was created via artificial insemination, and equipped
   with several modifications before being sent off to battle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An experiment led by Cherenkov to activate the Zohar
   emulator.

   The word "link" indicates that the procedure entails
   connecting the Zohar with another entity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A logic propulsion device.

   A new type of propulsion system which replaced traditional
   reactionary propulsion systems. It works by reconfiguring
   the spatial phase around its direction of travel.

   Substantial amounts of energy are needed to power this
   system, but since the energy source is relatively easy to
   compact, the system is being considered for use in fleets

   Short for "Local Positioning System."

   A system which monitors the location and physical status
   of each crew member within a vessel, and reports that
   information to the CIC (Combat Intelligence Center).

   The LPS onboard the Woglinde (which had a capacity well over
   the total amount of data gathered), appears to have been
   overwhelmed by incessant use of the D.S.S.S. by the A.G.W.S.

   Without the support of the 100-Series Observational Units
   for search and adherence, the A.G.W.S. must calculate the 
   timing of the interference for the Gnosis on their own.
   Thus high demands on the D.S.S.S. apparently overloaded
   the CIC mainframe, which constantly backs up the D.S.S.S.
   of every A.G.W.S.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A mark that appeared on Cherenkov's forehead.

   This marking is given to every individual who has undergone
   the personality corrective procedure.

   The mark is made by modifying the inner skin at a molecular
   level, then connecting that area with the part of the brain
   that was corrected. Therefore, it appears when the
   recipient's emotions rise beyond a certain threshold.

   Refers to the Buddhist practice of holding a memorial for the
   deceased every 7 days for 49 days, as well as the services
   given during the anniversary of the deceased.

   Shion's brother, Jin, has apparently read about this Buddhist

   vicious battles.

   As for what exactly happened in Miltia at the time, that
   story will have to wait.

   The MT field of the temporal lobe.

   Damage to this area of the brain results in a condition called
   "motion blindness," in which the eyes can see but cannot
   track the continuous motion of an object (such as a person
   who is running or a moving car). Instead, objects in motion
   appear as a series of flash photography images.

   It is said that to individuals with this condition, a normal
   conversation is perceived as a teleconference call with
   very slow transmission speeds.

   Short for "Multiple Weapons System."

   A portable, multi-function weapon storage unit designed
   and built by Shion's younger colleague Miyuki.

   Contained within the unit are various types of weapons
   including fighting knuckles, taser rods, and anti-Gnosis
   beam launchers. It also has a built-in shield that utilizes
   spatial phase shifting, thus providing a high level of
   defensive ability in addition to the offensive capability.
   The unit also contains a makeshift Logic Drive, which not
   only counterbalances but also enhances physical attacks.

   Thus even the weakest individuals can go head-to-head
   with an armored tactical weapon (in theory).

   trigger a violent reaction to the chemical which
   controls his emotions.

   Serial number of the artificial dog that Ziggy gave to his
   stepson as a gift.

   His phrase "I wanted to get you a real one..." reveals how
   real purebred dogs were extremely rare in that age, and
   Ziggy, a policeman, could not possibly afford one. Hence,
   cheaper artificial dogs were popularized as substitutes.

   "Nexus" is the name of the company that manufactures
   these artificial dogs, and their lifespan exceeds well
   beyond four years.

   Notice of Cloning Procedure Completion                                150
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A document which Cherenkov's wife received from the
   Federation health department.

   Since the revocation of the Life Recycling Act, strict
   restrictions were placed on the process of cloning for
   personal reasons. After a lengthy application process,
   only those deemed physically and mentally sound, with a
   record of positive contributions to the Federation
   government, are granted this privilege.

   For Cherenkov's wife, who has always avoided intimacy
   (both physical and emotional) with others, the method
   of cloning to leave behind descendants must have been
   a fairly natural decision.

   However, to Cherenkov, who dreamed (or imagined that he
   dreamed) of experiencing a connection with others, her
   decision came as an unbearable blow, a negation of his
   very existence and purpose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A weapon which utilizes the principle of phase transfer
   within a vacuum.

   The main body is compacted to Planck scale, and it expands
   into true space once it receives the system activation
   key from the cartridge.

   The part that looks like a handgun is actually a part of the
   phase transfer cannon, and once the cannon is activated it
   doubles as the laser locking device and trigger component.

   In the story, the "mass" in the phrase "...by limiting the
   phase transfer mass..." refers to mass in vacuum and the
   amount of fluctuation in its phase.

   Occasional Gnosis sightings have been recorded throughout
   history, but due to the small scale of attacks and minimal
   damage which resulted, most of these encounters were lost
   as unofficial reports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Although called a photon torpedo, this weapon actually
   utilizes matter/anti-matter reactions. Matter and
   anti-matter are isolated in a protective field that
   is disengaged right before reaching the target,
   releasing the destructive force of matter/anti-matter
   reaction.

   The "photon" refers to the bright light given off by the
   protective field once it is launched. Due to the extreme
   difficulty in creating anti-matter, the amount of
   reaction from one photon torpedo is minimal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   One of the U-TIC Organization's operational bases, it is
   comprised of several linked asteroids, and serves as
   Margulis' post.

     *Pleroma
     This term and concept can be found in both Jungian
     psychology and Gnostic doctrine.

   Although we will not reveal any answers at this point, it
   may be of interest to delve further into this concept. It
   may offer a glimpse of things to come in the future of
   Xenosaga, or it may provide some insight into the various
   themes that appear in the current story.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short for "Pistolet Makarova," the gun which Gaignun
   gave to Jr.

   An automatic pistol made in the former USSR, it was issued
   to the Soviet army in 1951, replacing the Tokarev TT1933.
   It uses a 9x18mm round, which is slower and therefore packs
   less penetrating power than the older Tokarevs. It holds
   eight rounds in the cartridge plus one in the chamber.

   The background story is that this gun, which Gaignun
   acquired at an auction, was made by the former Soviet

   Union as a gift to a foreign VIP.

   A less known fact, however, is that Jr. had already
   purchased a SPP-1 at another auction, unbeknownst
   to Gaignun...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The U.M.N. acts as a recording medium, holding every
   incident and every phenomenon in this world, as
   permanent records.

   Porters are agent-like A.I.s that exist in order to manage
   and preserve those records. Porters owned by the govern-
   ment run U.M.N. Management Agency usually manage an
   individual's information, whereas corporations usually
   have their own proprietary Porters manage their
   company records.

   The term "Porter" is an encompassing name for "any A.I.
   that behaves autonomously within the network." For
   example, mail traffic is regulated by a type of A.I.
   called the Mail Porter.

   There are as many different functions for Porters, as
   there are business models practiced on the Net.

   postwar reparations                                                   168
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A policy for reparatory compensation, established at the
   end of the Miltian Conflict, that caused a severe drain
   on all parties.

   However, many sectors from various autonomous states
   failed to benefit from these reparations, and after
   14 years, the issue is yet to be fully resolved.

   potential phenomena                                                   169
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A term mentioned by Nephilim.

   In other words, one possible path of the future. Since the
   future has yet to be determined, nothing is definite;
   only a myriad of possibilities exist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A humanoid machine used to carry heavy loads inside the
   Woglinde.

   It is standard issue labor machinery, used throughout the
   Federation. Some of them are equipped with a flamethrower
   on the right arm.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A technique used to detect traces of Zohar wave energies.

   The term is derived from a DNA sequence analysis technique.

   Procurator                                                            172
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An agent-like A.I. which extracts services from the U.M.N.,
   as requested by the user.

   A Procurator is essential in order to navigate through the
   U.M.N.'s vast information network, and it manages most of
   the routine work related to the U.M.N. in place of the user.
   For example, the task of sending and receiving mail is
   overseen by one type of A.I. called the "Mail Porter."

   By having the Procurator act as a go-between for the user
   and the Mail Porter, the user can send and receive mail
   simply by instructing the Procurator, without having to
   deal with the Mail Porter.

   The environmental simulator and database can also be used
   via the Procurator (though a specific plug-in is necessary).

   Usually instructions to the Procurator are given vocally,
   but some complex operations require the use of a keyboard.

   A smaller Procurator resides within mobile units such as the
   Connection Gear. Vector's line of Connection Gear, the
   "Rios" series, also contain a Procurator named ANGE.

   Incidentally, Shion has replaced this Procurator with
   another which she created, Bunnie.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An immense industrial plant built under the supervision of
   Joachim Mizrahi.

   Although its purpose is unknown, it has the power to absorb
   Gnosis and convert them into a power source.

   It is also the birthplace of MOMO.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A protrusion at the front of a vessel which breeches the
   walls of enemy ships.

   The Durandal has a holding area for troops at the very
   tip of its ram, enabling them to engage the enemy
   immediately after impact.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An artificial human.

   A wonder of molecular bioengineering, its biological
   composition comes in various forms based on need, from
   carbon based duplicates of real humans to those based on
   silicon or liquid metal. Many of the Realians onboard the
   Woglinde were made by Vector, and they are hybrid models
   with a carbon/ silicon base.

   Since the Miltian Conflict, the alteration of a Realian's
   emotions is no longer allowed. The only exceptions are
   for Realians in the military or other dangerous
   occupations, such as terraforming.

   Their basic rights equal those of humans and are recog-
   nized by law. However, due to the fact that their minds
   are initialized with a slight bias, all Realians tend to
   display similar personality traits. This bias is applied
   not only for the purpose of preventing criminal behavior
   by Realians, but also in consideration of humans who may
   feel threatened by their "superiority" (albeit only in
   certain specialized skills).

   Several companies manufacture Realians, but Vector makes
   the basic program (in other words the central nervous
   system) of all Realians.

   This program is essentially a black box, and any modifi-
   cation beyond regular maintenance and adjustments can
   only be performed by Vector.

   Individuals who salvage space wreckage to sell (sometimes
   after fixing them up) to brokers.

   Laws governing this type of activity vary from state to

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Vector's latest development in weapons technology.

   Named after Wagner's <Ring of the Nibelung: Prelude -
   Rhinegold>, in which the Rhinemaidens are three naiads
   who guard the magic Rhinegold lying at the bottom
   of the river.

   The three ships which have this weapon onboard are called
   Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Flosshilde (after the original
   Rhinemaidens). The vessels themselves are massive
   battleships over 8000m in length, and are equipped
   with this specialized anti-Gnosis weapon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In <Psychology and Alchemy> (1944), C.G. Jung refers to
   rubedo, or "reddening," as one stage in the process of
   human individuation as symbolized in alchemic terms.

   A nickname for U.R.T.V. Unit #666 (Jr.), who unlike the
   other units, has bright red hair.

   Apparently Jr. got his name because he is physically
   smaller in stature than Gaignun, hence "Gaignun Jr."

   Planetary capital of the current Miltian autonomous state
   government.

   The planent is 13,200km in diameter, with a gravity ratio
   1.03. It was only recently terraformed, so it still has an
   abundance of forests. The atmosphere-generating
   nanomachines within the ocean are still active, causing
   the planet to appear light green from space.

   The man with motorized sunglasses, with whom Margulis was
   discussing the Zohar and plans for future, at the command
   center on Pleroma.

   His appearance and demeanor indicate that he is a scientist

   She was once part of a group of people, who were illegally
   "owned" by a pharmaceutical company that used them as
   guinea pigs. Twelve years ago, Gaignun rescued her along
   with Mary, and she has made her home in the Foundation
   ever since.

   AGE: 22 years old

   Assigned to Vector Industries' First R&D Division at the
   age of 18 in T.C. 4763.

   Her official title is Chief Engineer of the KOS-MOS Project
   General Operation System Research Center, Vector
   Industries First R&D Division. Although two years younger
   than Allen, Shion is a year his senior in the corporate
   hierarchy of Vector.

   Although she appears clumsy at times, she is actually quite
   athletic. In particular, her high kicks are powerful enough
   to render a grown man unconscious. She apparently also
   wields a jujitsu-like technique passed on from her
   grandfather, but unfortunately this skill does not
   appear in this episode.

   S.O.C.E. (Subcommittee On Close Encounters)                           191
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A panel of researchers convened by the Federation
   government in T.C. 4754 to counter the Gnosis phenomena.

   While it is called a "Sub" committee, it has over 2000
   members representing government agencies, corporations,
   and various scientific fields. At its operational core
   are seven members, each of whom holds high positions in
   the Federation.

   Juli Mizrahi, MOMO's creator, is one of the seven members.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   One of several giant machines created by Joachim Mizrahi.

   It emits a song-like frequency that only certain individuals
   can hear, but the actual purpose of this device is yet
   unknown.

   It does, however, curiously reappear throughout the story,
   be it in the meaning behind the word "madness" uttered by
   Jr. and Margulis, or the appearance of a girl with the
   same name. The fact that Shion saw this device on Miltia
   as a little girl, only furthers the mystery.

   Species Preservation Act                                              193
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A law enacted in order to revive the human race, which had
   degenerated due to the harmful effects of the Life
   Recycling Act.

   The purpose behind this legislation was to preserve and
   propogate a pure breed of humans that was untouched by
   genetic engineering, cloning, or organ enhancements. It also
   strove to restore the original genetic code that had been
   altered by the Life Recycling Act.

   Due to the fact that enforcement is left to the discretion
   of each autonomous state, there is a pointed lack of
   standardization and effectiveness across the
   multitude of jurisdictions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Refers to Vector's "Combat Technology Research
   Laboratory."

   A division within Vector which evaluates all weapons created
   by the company, for their wartime efficacy. In some cases,
   it also develops new technologies as well.

   It is separate from the other R&D divisions for practical
   reasons, and is located onboard the Dämmerung.

   AGE: 22 years old

   A younger colleague of Allen.

   Togashi joined Vector's First R&D Division right after the
   incident in which KOS-MOS went out of control.

   He finds great satisfaction in giving his mentor Allen a
   hard time.

   His hobby is judo.
   And he is in love with Miyuki -- maybe.

   Pilot of the passenger cargo ship, Elsa.

   Normally handsome and debonair, he completely changes
   when he's in the pilot seat. To his credit though, he
   is in fact a brilliant pilot, having saved the Elsa
   from countless perils.

   ...too close to fire the cannons                                      201
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In zero gravity space warfare, a basic rule of engagement is
   to take into account the possibility of incurring damage to
   oneself via debris from a destroyed target.

   During the story, an officer exclaims, "We're too close to
   fire the cannons!" because the Gnosis were too close to the
   ship, and could not be fired upon for fear of debris damaging
   the ship.

   (Although it sure did look like they were firing those things
   with reckless abandon...)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The U.M.N.'s columns are divided into separate routes
   according to their use. The trade column is a route
   used mainly by cargo and passenger vessels.

   During the story, Ziggy chose to navigate through this
   particular column, in hopes that the heavy traffic will
   interfere with his pursuers' tracking system.

   transfer system                                                       203
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A material transport technique which utilizes an unique
   feature of the U.M.N.

   It's usage is fairly common in this age. However,
   transference of materials with amorphous network
   information -- that is, living organisms -- is considered
   virtually impossible. This is due to the serious impact
   such transference has on the actual information
   contained within these living networks, such as
   personality and biological functions.

   Transference of living organisms requires a protective
   shield, and due to the size of such shield-generating
   systems, it would in turn require the use of a vehicle,
   like a space vessel. This explains why Matthews' ship
   is both a passenger and cargo ship.

   transfer wave                                                         204
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A signal emitted by the U-TIC Organization's Auto-Tech
   terminals, which specify transfer coordinates.

   After infiltration of the Elsa, the Auto-Tech began
   transferring its remote drones from outside the ship
   into various coordinates throughout the ship's interior.

   Since the drones were not transferred directly onto the
   bridge, it appears that the transfer wave only works
   within a certain range.

   Why the Auto-Tech chose to take over the aft hangar,
   is yet unknown.

   Type 7 personality corrective procedure                               206
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A personality control procedure administered to Cherenkov.

   In this age, every violent criminal whose behavior is a
   result of brain abnormalities, is given this procedure
   without exception.

   The procedure itself actually entails implanting a nano-
   machine which suppresses emotional impulses into the brain.
   However, there are a few individuals that are not cured by
   this, and even more extreme procedures, Type 8 and Type 9,
   are available.

   Incidentally, the ratio of male to female recipients of
   this procedure is 8 to 2, an increase in the proportion
   of females from the current ratio of male to female
   violent criminals with abnormal impulses, which is
   9 to 1.

   Type G target drone                                                   207
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Drones used as targets during simulated battles.

   They differ from ordinary ones in that they are programmed
   to emulate Gnosis.

   Uberhumans                                                            208
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   During the heyday of the Life Recycling Act, many people
   opted to undergo artificial procedures to enhance physical
   abilities or to increase brain capacity. This term is used
   to describe those individuals or their descendants.

   Although Allen refers to them as "mutants," these gifted
   individuals do not exhibit any external differences when
   compared to ordinary humans.

   Current Federation law prohibits any acts of discrimination
   against such people, yet feelings of hostility still abound
   in various corners of the galaxy. The Kukai Foundation not
   only protects these individuals, but also provides them
   with a means to support themselves.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The entity depicted as a massive shockwave originating from
   Old Miltia, in the futuristic vision shown to Shion by Nephilim.

   Judging from the words of Gaignun, Helmer, and Wilhelm, it
   is clearly related to the incident which occurred 14 years
   ago.

   Nephilim claims that the wave is a living consciousness,
   but the truth is yet to be revealed...

   Ultra Wide-Range Hilbert                                              210
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The deployment of the Hilbert Effect over an extremely large
   area.

   Ordinarily, the range of KOS-MOS' Hilbert Effect is set to
   cover a radius of about 300,000km. However, when Shion
   witnessed the impending massive swarm of Gnosis, she
   decided to enlarge the effective range to a radius of
   several hundred AU (astronomical units).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short for "Unus Mundus Network."

   An informational network that spans the entire universe.
   Its non-locality is a large factor in its use in space
   warps and FTL (faster than light) communications.

   The term <unus mundus>, literally "one world," was used by
   psychiatrist C.G. Jung to describe a state beyond this world
   where every contradiction in physics, like synchronicity and
   the EPR Paradox, can be explained.

   A place where every relationship, such as that of the mind
   to mind, or mind to matter, can also make sense.

   U.M.N. Control Center                                                 212
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The U.M.N. Transport Gate management facility, located in
   Second Miltia.

   This and all facilities associated with the U.M.N. come under
   the jurisdiction of the U.M.N. Management Agency. As such,
   the U.M.N. Management Agency virtually controls all
   information within the Galaxy Federation, making it a
   very influential agency within the central government.

   The agency relies on Vector to provide 98% of its
   facilities and resources.

   U.M.N. pulse                                                          213
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A navigational signal, constantly being emitted from the
   U.M.N. transfer column.

   Each column emits a different pulse, so one must receive
   the pulse from a column located at the destination, or
   the set of pulses from the columns located along the
   jump route, during a gate-jump.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   U.M.N. transfer column                                                214
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The U.M.N. Transport Gate has relay points called columns
   located at certain intervals in hyperspace. These columns
   connect every Transport Gate in the galaxy to one
   another. It is similar to the connections within a
   neural network.

   Since each column has a limited area of influence, a gate-
   jump cannot be performed from outside that area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short for "U.M.N. phone."

   A type of wireless communication device used commonly in
   this time period.

   The Connection Gear, which Shion uses all the time, also
   comes with a communications function, but since Connection
   Gears are rather expensive, not everyone utilizes them.
   Shion also carries a U.M.N. phone as a backup
   communication device.

   Since the Connection Gear uses a special communications
   line reserved for the military, in situations where the
   central system of the CIC (Combat Intelligence Center)
   is congested, it is easier to get a connection via the UNP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short for "U-DO Retro Virus."
   Also known as U-Retrovirus.

   A biological weapon whose life energy wavelength cancels
   that of U-DO.

   669 units were created by the late Dr. Dmitri Yuriev,
   head of the Yuriev Institute.

   Dr. Yuriev is the genetic father of the U.R.T.V.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Official name: Unknown Territory Intervention and Creation
   Agency.

   An agency connected closely with the Miltian Conflict,
   references of which are made throughout Episode I.
   It was buried in obscurity for decades, but reappeared
   in T.C. 4767, which is when this story begins.

   An independent organization not associated with the Galaxy
   Federation, it nevertheless boasts a level of technology
   and military force that far surpass those of the
   Federation government or military.

   Its origins can be traced back to the Mizrahi Neuro-
   science Institute, which means that Joachim Mizrahi
   is the agency's founder. However, the connection
   between him and Margulis is yet unknown.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   One of the visual fields of the brain.

   The human brain is said to contain 30 or more of these
   visual fields. Damage to both sides of the V4 visual

   Vector First R&D Division                                             220
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Referred to as "First Division" amongst Vector employees.

   Its origins date back to a joint venture by the government
   and private sector to manage the U.M.N. Although it now
   functions as a department within a corporation, it has
   retained its original title of "Division."

   After relegating the management of the U.M.N. to the
   government, the Division's primary function has been the
   development of various computer chips and supporting
   software for industrial supercomputer A.I.s.

   The KOS-MOS R&D project, to which Shion and her team are
   assigned to, sought to develop an emotively controlled OS.

   Vector fleet design department                                        221
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A section within Vector's Second R&D Division which
   specializes in the construction of interstellar warships.

   The Woglinde also originated from here.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Vector Industries                                                     222
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The largest business conglomerate in the Federation,
   and an integral part of modern civilization.

   It is involved in the production and distribution of almost
   every product, from food and medicine, software and
   hardware, to communication and weapons.

   It has a multitude of divisions, of which the core components
   are the First, Second, and Third R&D Divisions.

   Vector Industries has a very long history, and its presence
   dates back to the initial formation of the Federation.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Vector Second R&D Division                                            223
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The division responsible for hardware development.

   Its duties include the development and production of
   Federation fleet vessels and A.G.W.S.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Vector Third R&D Division                                             224
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   One of the three core R&D divisions of Vector Industries.

   Its sole purpose is to oversee the development, production,
   training, and distribution of Realians.

   Though her motives were unknown to others, Shion
   apparently requested a reassignment to this division.

   ...violation of protocol                                              225
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The records within KOS-MOS' subconscious are part of
   Vector's most highly classified information, and in the
   story Allen declares that any unauthorized duplication
   of them is a clear violation of company regulations.

   Actually, the motive behind the duplication is to clear any
   suspicion toward the Foundation (of which Vector is a
   primary investor), and the Second Miltian government.
   Therefore, in light of the situation, it seems highly
   unlikely that permission for such would be withheld.

   The only requirement would be to censor any information
   that should be withheld from the public, (this is not
   considered a falsification of records), and filter the
   record.

   However, Shion decided that the current situation qualifies
   as an emergency, and took it upon herself to move forward
   without any pre-authorization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A piloting technique where a vessel's force field is
   intersected with the inner walls of hyperspace in
   order to obtain high velocity.

   This technique pushes the vessel to the very edge
   of hyperspace, therefore it requires extraordinary
   piloting skills.

   Weapons-Grade Realian                                                 227
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A Realian specially modified for combat.

   Their senses and physical abilities are better developed than
   those of regular Realians. They are also designed to operate
   for long periods of time in the battlefield, and their emotions
   have been modified so that fear or other feelings detrimental
   to combat will not surface. (Although Realians in general are
   designed not to feel fear, there are occasional anomalies.)

   Although the Realians' weapons appear similar to those used
   by humans, the caliber of their weaponry is comparable to
   that of a tank-mounted gun, and they fire reinforced
   ammunition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Refers to the octopus-like Martians invented by H.G. Wells.

   The in-game reference is to a comment Shion makes
   regarding Allen stubbornness:

     "You're usually so hardheaded with your logic and
     preconceptions, I was a little worried that you'd
     become like one of Wells' aliens."

   For better or worse, it appears as though Shion believes
   that Wells' Aliens have very hard heads.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A phenomenon in which a human being touched by a Gnosis
   turns completely white and shatters into dust.

   Shion and Cherenkov have both experienced a near-
   whitening. Cherenkov later transformed into a Gnosis,
   but whether Shion will do the same is unknown.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Founder and CEO of the interplanetary conglomerate,
   Vector Industries.

   He also served as the Executive Committee Director of the
   Galaxy Federation, up to a decade ago.

   Like chaos, his origins and personal history are shrouded
   in mystery.

   A man in a scarlet cloak, his advisor and aide, is ever present
   at his side and the strains of Wagner can always be heard
   in his office.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Built by Vector Industries and loaned to the Federation
   Marine Corps, it was the first battleship specifically
   built to combat Gnosis.

   Although Vector hastily added a bridge and a bare bones
   propulsion system to make it operable on the test flight,
   the ship remains eighty percent incomplete.

   Due to its status as a test prototype, the Vector logo
   can be seen in place of the usual Federation Marine
   Corps insignia.

   The ship consists of a unique bi-level design, which
   enables it to split into an upper and lower section. The
   upper section houses the bridge. The lower section is not
   actually a part of the vessel's body; it was created with
   recycled material to temporarily house the new Logic
   Drive during its test flight.

   Vessel length: 1000m

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A series of research data left by the late Joachim Mizrahi,
   sought by the U-TIC Organization and the S.O.C.E.

   In the story, this data is said to exist in MOMO's
   unconscious memory, although it is not very certain.

   Dialogs surrounding it suggest that this data is vital to
   the Zohar Project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Ziggurat Industries Cyborg version 8.0.

   Since the advent of Realian technology, all effort to develop
   new cyborgs was abandoned, but pre-existing models
   continued to be upgraded.

   However, with the enactment of the Species Preservation
   Act this practice was also stopped, making version 8.0
   the last in the Ziggurat series.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A corporate entity specializing in cybernetic technology
   and biotechnology.

   After the enactment of the Species Preservation Act, it
   eliminated its ailing cybernetics department and shifted
   its resources towards the development of nanotechnology.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4637

   A combat cyborg assigned the task of recovering and
   protecting MOMO, the 100-Series Observational Realian.

   Upon his death in T.C. 4667 at the age of 30, his body was
   donated to science, and two years later he was reborn as
   a combat cyborg.

   The last rank he held was captain of the 1875th Special
   Operations Command detachment of the Federation Police
   Bureau.

   He is currently appropriated to the S.O.C.E. According to
   Federation law, upon death, an individual's body is desig-
   nated as "public property", thus they are no longer able
   to control their own fates.  Perhaps this is why Ziggy
   considers himself simply equipment owned by the S.O.C.E.

   His thinking is in direct contrast to MOMO, who longs to be
   human. Ziggy constantly strives to turn himself completely
   into a machine through repeated tune-ups that eliminate
   his human parts, piece by piece.

   His looks belie his extremely old age, and his advice gained
   from years of experience is both practical and precise.

   His former name was Jan Sauer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The incident that triggered a massive war within the
   Federation, which culminated in the Miltian Conflict.

   Although details pertaining to this incident are unknown,
   it was around this time that Cherenkov was born as a
   super soldier (biological weapon).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A mysterious golden object, and the focal point of the story
   throughout the entire Xenosaga series.

   The word originates from <Zohar ('Book of Splendor')>, a
   central literary work of the <Kabbalah>.

   The Anti-Gnosis Observational Realians that were slated
   for duty onboard the Woglinde.

   They are capable of unleashing the Hilbert Effect.

   100-Series Realian                                                    240
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Another name for the 100-Series Observational Units.

   The 100-Series System, which combines D.S.S.S. and the
   Hilbert Effect, is a brand new technology which was
   only recently developed. The entire system weighs over
   10 tons, making it virtually impossible to scale it
   down to human size. Thus the 100-Series System that was
   issued to the military consisted of two parts; the main
   system (a 15m x 15m block resembling a supercomputer),
   and a mass-produced 100-Series Realian as a terminal
   device.

   This system and the one installed in KOS-MOS share the
   same technology, leading to speculation that the two
   are somehow connected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A Federation Marine Corps Division assigned to escort the
   cruiser Woglinde.

   Since the Division's HQ was not in close proximity to the
   Federation bases, resupply of their equipment was delayed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   BORN: T.C. 4735
   AGE: 32 years old

   A first lieutenant of the Galaxy Federation Marine Corps
   and a brilliant A.G.W.S. pilot.

   He is afflicted with DME addiction (which is caused by
   the consumption of Realian body tissue), as evidenced
